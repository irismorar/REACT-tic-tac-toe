**TIC-TAC-TOE**

Make a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Screenshots attached to this email show what the UI should look like.

Requirements:
- the game is played by two players and Player 1 always goes first
- the currently active player has their name colored and the other one has their name grayed out; each player has a different color (see screenshots)
- when the active player has made their move, the game automatically switches to the other player
- at any time before the game is over you can press a "restart" button to restart the game
- when the game ends the following things happen:
  1) it is no longer possible to click on the board to add an "x" or a "o" (obviously)
  2) if a player has won then the winning combination of three "x" or three "o" is highlighted in white (see screenshot)
  3) an appropriate message is shown - see screenshots; note that the message is slightly different when someone has won vs. if it's a draw
  4) if a player has won then they remain shown in their color and the other player is grayed out
  5) a "play again" button is shown that will restart the game when pressed
